    <p>Gintoki Sakata (Japanese: 坂田 銀時, Hepburn: Sakata Gintoki) is a fictional character in the manga and anime 
        franchise Gin Tama created by Hideaki Sorachi. Gintoki is the protagonist of the series and his name serves 
        as part of the basis of the series' title. He is introduced as a former rebel samurai who lives in a
         fictionalized version of 1860s Japan after being invaded and transformed by aliens. Gintoki once fought
          the alien invaders until he realized the lack of sense in doing so, leading to him choosing to instead 
          make a living as a freelancer for hire in Edo alongside his friends Shinpachi Shimura and Kagura in order
           to pay the monthly rent. Across the series, more details about Gintoki's past are revealed leading him 
           to encounter former friends as enemies. As the main character, Gintoki has appeared in most of the episodes 
           of the anime series, as well as in other media related to the franchise, including the film and all of the 
           spin-off video games and original video animations.</p>

    <h2>Origins</h2>
    <p>Sorachi created the character after suggestions of his editors of having silver-haired samurai. He was
         originally going to be based on Hijikata Toshizō, the vice-captain from the Shinsengumi special forces. 
         However, Sorachi changed his mind as he did not want the main character to be working in an organization and
          further remodeled his design into the present one. In the anime series Gintoki was voiced by Tomokazu Sugita,
           who enjoyed his character. For the English release of the first movie, he was voiced by Chris Patton, 
           whereas in the Gintama° episodes Gintoki was played by Michael Daingerfield; later, Roly Gutiérrez dubbed
            him in the first anime series.[6] Shun Oguri portrays him in the live-action films.</p>
    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Gintoki Sakata is a freelancer former samurai living in an era where aliens known as the Amanto have come to Earth 
        after the Joi War, a battle in which the latter defeated the former. As a child, he was taught by Shoyo Yoshida, 
        with his classmates being two of his future Joi allies, Kotaro Katsura and Shinsuke Takasugi.[13] Shoyo was 
        unjustly accused of trying to raise an army, which resulted in his capture, with Gintoki and his friends entering
         the Joi War to rescue their teacher.[14] During that period, he was known as the "White Demon" (白夜叉, 
         Shiroyasha, "White Knight" in English dub) due to his silver hair and white coat he wore in battle, which, 
         combined with his impressive capabilities as a swordsman, made him famous among his comrades and struck fear 
         into Amanto.[15] During a time in the Joui War when he, Katsura and Takasugi were captured by Tendosho, under 
         orders by Sada Sada, Gintoki was forced to execute his master without any choice before his master's final 
         bidding to him right in front of his comrades' eyes.</p>
    <p>After his master's death, Gintoki chooses to open a freelance business where he could handle matters his own way, 
        while continuing to live by his own samurai code. In his job, he gets two employees, the samurai apprentice 
        Shinpachi Shimura and the alien girl Kagura and comes to have a close relationship with both of them.[16][17] 
        The group often have problems to pay the monthly rent for Otose, Gintoki's landlady whom he swore to protect 
        after eating the food offerings meant to her husband's grave.[18]</p>
